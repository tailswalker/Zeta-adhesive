# Zeta-adhesive
One-dimensional simulation of an adhesive LGCA with Zeta-distributed jump lengths.

The notebook contains everything necessary for running simulations of the model. Depending on the output, not all parameters need to be defined.

Commented lines with code correspond to code snippets which are necessary for certain outputs, but are not used for others.
